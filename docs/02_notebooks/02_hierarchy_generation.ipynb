    "\n",
    "First, we will load an example project and select a frame / board from a page for hierarchy generation. The current approach works on frame, respectively board level to reduce the number of shapes in a single prompt but also as boards within Penpot are typically supposed to act as logical separations of sub-designs within a single page and therefore can serve as point of reference for the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, that the hierarchy generation works for some files and designs better than others. If a design inherently has a clear and hierarchical structure, our inference algorithm will do a pretty good job transferring this visual information into a formal structure. In cases with little inherent structure, e.g. a grid of icons, the generated hierarchies might be flat or of little information."
