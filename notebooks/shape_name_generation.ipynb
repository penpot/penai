    "In this notebook, we demonstrate the automated generation of meaningful shape names based on their visual appearance and the context in which they are embedded within a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant challenge in developing this approach was designing prompts and metadata in such a way that the model can reliably reason about design elements. These elements may be small, ambiguous in their appearance or visual structure, and present in documents with a high density of shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We devised two different solutions:\n",
    "- Using explicit visual annotations to guide the model\n",
    "- A simplified approach with only two unannotated reference images and bounding boxes described in the prompt\n",

    "1. **Derive the top-level frame of a shape:** Pages in Penpot are typically organized into different design groups with frames. Since providing the context of an entire page to the model isn't practical, the top-level frame of a shape is used as the \"context limit.\"\n",
    "2. **Render reference images:** The top-level frame is rendered, and the shape to be named is cropped. This provides sufficient visual context for the model while requiring only one rendering pass.\n",
    "3. **Construct the prompt:** The prompt contains the two reference images and additional metadata in text form. We will take a closer look at this step shortly.\n",
    "4. **Extract the name from the output:** The model is instructed to provide the output in JSON format. However, for models that don't fully support JSON output, additional logic is applied to extract the name from potentially malformed outputs."
